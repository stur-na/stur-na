Hello community, my name is Yinka and i'm interested in web and mobile development.
I just started learning python programming language october 25 2021.
However, i got my hands on html/css and an intro in javascipt some years back
I'm really open to learning python and its various frameworks for development.
I'd be documenting my progress and putting up my little projects on here, feel free to help and correct my codes in making me a better programmer and achieving my goals.
Thank you.
